# üçî Food Delivery System
## **I. Project Overview**
The Food Delivery System is a Java console application allowing users to register, log in, and place food orders. Users can explore restaurant menus, add items to a cart, and complete the checkout process. The application includes user authentication and a small database of users, food items, and orders.

This project showcases essential Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java and demonstrates a simple yet scalable structure for future expansions.

## **II. Application of OOP Principles**
This project showcases core OOP principles as follows:

<ins>**Encapsulation:** </ins> Classes like User, MenuItem, and Cart encapsulate related data and functionality. Data fields are private, and access is controlled through public methods.

<ins>**Abstraction:**</ins> Functionalities such as user authentication, cart management, and database interactions are abstracted into dedicated service classes (UserService, CartService). This makes the code modular and easier to maintain.

<ins>**Inheritance:**</ins> The project is structured to support future enhancements, such as adding specific types of users (e.g., premium users). Currently, inheritance can be extended for user roles or item categories.

<ins>**Polymorphism:**</ins> Through potential method overloading and interface-based implementations, polymorphism enables the addition of diverse user types or payment methods, increasing flexibility and scalability.

## III. Integration of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
The project aligns with <ins>**SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**</ins> by encouraging mindful food ordering to reduce waste. Users are able to review their cart and order only what they need. Future updates can include tracking ordering patterns or suggesting sustainable meal options, further contributing to responsible consumption practices.
